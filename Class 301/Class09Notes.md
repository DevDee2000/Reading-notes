# Functional Programming

- Q. What is functional programming?


- A. a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation 


- Q. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?


- A. We know it's a pure function if it returns the same result if given the same argument(it is also referred as deterministic), and it does not cause any observable side effects


- Q. What are the benefits of a pure function?


- A. It's faster than a regular function, they use less memory, they are  simple and easy to understand, and the code is easier to test.


- Q. What is immutability?


- A. data's whose state cannot be changed after it's created. 


- Q. What is Referential transparency?


- A. a function that consistently yields the same result for the same input.


- Q. What is a module?


- A. components of a server 


- Q. What does the word ‘require’ do?


- A. imports external modules that exist in separate files.


- Q. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?


- A. We do that by requiring it in our current file


- Q. What do we have to do to make a module available?

- A. we must export it.
