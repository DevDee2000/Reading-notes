# How to debug for absolute beginners


Without fail, the code we write as software developers doesn’t always do what we expected it to do. Sometimes it does something completely different! When this happens, the next task is to figure out why, and although we might be tempted to just keep staring at our code for hours, it’s much easier and more efficient to use a debugging tool or debugger.

A debugger, unfortunately, isn’t something that can magically reveal all the problems or “bugs” in our code. Debugging means to run your code step by step in a debugging tool like Visual Studio, to find the exact point where you made a programming mistake. You then understand what corrections you need to make in your code and debugging tools often allow you to make temporary changes so you can continue running the program.

Using a debugger effectively is also a skill that takes time and practice to learn but is ultimately a fundamental task for every software developer. In this article, we introduce the core principles of debugging and provide tips to get you started.
