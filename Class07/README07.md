## <ins>Control flow</ins>

- The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

- Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

- Contorl flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of excecution.

## **Conditionals**

- A condition is a set of rules that can interrupt normal code execution or change it, depending on whether the condition is completed or not.

- An instruction or a set of instructions is executed if a specific condition is fulfilled. Otherwise, another instruction is executed. It is also possible to repeat the execution of an instruction, or set of instructions, while a condition is not yet fulfilled.

## <ins>JavaScript Functions</ins>

- A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

- A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

- A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

- Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

- The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

- The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

## ***Function Invocation***

- The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)

- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
Automatically (self invoked)

## <ins>**Function Return**</ins>

- When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

- If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

- Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":
